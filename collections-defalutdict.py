# The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python.
# It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container,
# but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet.
# If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists,
# and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.
from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(list)
d["python"].append("awesome")
d["something-else"].append("not relevant")
d["python"].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print(i)

# ('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
# ('something-else', ['not relevant'])
