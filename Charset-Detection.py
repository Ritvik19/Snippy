# You can use the chardet module to detect the charset of a file.
# This can come in very useful when analyzing big piles of random text.
# Install with:

#! pip install chardet

# You now have an extra command-line tool called chardetect,
# which can be used like this:

#! chardetect somefile.txt
# somefile.txt: ascii with confidence 1.0
